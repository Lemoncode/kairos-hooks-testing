# 09 Pure Components Callback

In the previous sample we saw how to make a component pure using
_React.memo_, that's great, but when there's an issue
what happens if we pass a function created inside the functional component to the child component?
That function will be always different on every render thus
the _memo_ won't take effect.

How can we solve this? We can make use of _useCallback_, this won't mutate the setter
function unless we indicate any dependency (same approach as with _React.useEffect_).

# Steps

- We will take as starting point sample _00 boilerplate_. Copy the content of the
  project to a fresh folder an execute _npm install_.

```bash
npm install
```

- Let's open the _demo.tsx_ file. We will create a parent and a child component
  (this time the child component will just reset the name content).

_./src/demo.tsx_

```tsx
import React from "react";

interface Props {
  onReset: () => void;
}

const ResetValue: React.FC<Props> = React.memo((props) => {
  console.log(
    "Hey I'm only rendered the first time, check React.memo + callback"
  );

  return <button onClick={props.onReset}>Reset value</button>;
});

export const MyComponent = () => {
  const [username, setUsername] = React.useState("John");
  const [lastname, setLastname] = React.useState("Doe");

  const resetNameCallback = () => {
    setUsername("");
  };

  return (
    <>
      <h3>
        {username} {lastname}
      </h3>
      <input value={username} onChange={(e) => setUsername(e.target.value)} />
      <input value={lastname} onChange={(e) => setLastname(e.target.value)} />
      <ResetValue onReset={resetNameCallback} />
    </>
  );
};
```

- If we run the sample we will check that the render is always triggered
  (_resetNameCallback_ is always recreated, shallow compare will fail).

- The trick here is to use _React.useCallback_ and passing as a second
  argument an empty array (it will just hold the reference for the function
  forever).

```diff
import React from "react";

export const MyComponent = () => {
  const [username, setUsername] = React.useState("John");
  const [lastname, setLastname] = React.useState("Doe");


-  const resetNameCallback = () => {setUsername('');}
+  const resetNameCallback = React.useCallback(() => setUsername(''), []);

  return (
    <>
      <h3>
        {username} {lastname}
      </h3>
      <input value={username} onChange={e => setUsername(e.target.value)} />
      <input value={lastname} onChange={e => setLastname(e.target.value)} />
      <ResetValue onReset={resetNameCallback}>Reset name</ResetValue>
    </>
  );
};

const ResetValue = React.memo(props => {
  console.log(
    "Hey I'm only rendered the first time, check React.memo + callback"
  );

  return (
    <button onClick={props.onReset}>Reset value</button>
  );
});
```

- If we run he example, we can see that the rerender is no longer launched in the component.

How does this work? _useCallback_ will return a function that was originally created, and it returns this instead of creating a new one in each render, we achive this by passing an empty array as a second argument(as we did with _React.useEffect_) and if we omit the second parameter, this function will be reevaluated after each render.
